# SpaceCraft_Game

This Repository contains all the files of the project. When I will have some more spare time i want to state the details about the project progress from the beginning on, what challenges have arisen and the learning outcomes.

In this Project I wanted to apply some learned Coding skills, so i created a little game.

This is a little preview how the interface looks like

### In this game you are the little small yellow Rocket you can navigate the Rocket through the space with the arrow keys

  up = accelerate to the front
  
  down = accelerate/break to the back
  
  left/right = turning the spacecraft in another direction

### The aim of the game is to defend the planet in the middle of the screen by shooting the red enemy Rockets with laser beams befor they reach the planet.

  space = shooting laser beams

You can also crash into the enemies to destroy them. If a enemy is destroyed a explosion animation will occur.
If a enemy crashes into the planet a explosion of the enemy will occur as well.

I made this project for learning purposes and i spent some time at the evenings in the winter 2023/24 to build this projects.
I have more ideas to add. Maybe at a later time when i have some more free time.
